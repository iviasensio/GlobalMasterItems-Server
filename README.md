# Commentaries for Qlik Sense - Server side

This is the server side (backend) Nodejs module that enables a REST API for the ***commentaries extension*** for Qlik Sense available in this repository (https://github.com/mjromper/commentaries-qliksense).

### DEPENDENCIES

* The data (commentaries) is stored in files using NeDB (https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb) which is an embedded persistent or in memory database for NodeJs. Its API is a subset of MongoDB's and it's plenty fast!!

## REST-API endpoints

Commentary object definition:
```
    {
    	_id: "string" 				// Autogenerated by neDB
        created: "date",	 		// Ej: "2017-04-18T10:33:53.506Z"
        text: "string",				// The message to store
        user: "string",				// User who wrote this message
        sheetId: "string",			// The sheet this message belongs to
        anchor: "string",			// Specifify dimension(s) this message is attached to
        appId: "string"				// The AppId this message belongs to
    }
```


Retrieve all commentary attached to a sheet and an anchor
```
    GET - https://HOSTNAME:8200/api/comments?sheetId=SHEET_ID&anchor=ANCHOR_VALUE
```
